These instructions were created on Ubuntu 12.04.

You need a 64-bit install because ZFS is generally considered to be
happier under 64-bit, and the PPA only supports 64-bit..

Install ZFS:

   Based on this guide:

      https://github.com/zfsonlinux/pkg-zfs/wiki/HOWTO-install-Ubuntu-to-a-Native-ZFS-Root-Filesystem

   apt-get install python-software-properties
   apt-add-repository --yes ppa:zfs-native/stable
   apt-get update
   apt-get install debootstrap ubuntu-zfs
   modprobe zfs
   Edit /etc/default/zfs and set "ZFS_MOUNT" and "ZFS_UMOUNT" to "yes".

Create ZFS pool for backups:

   You will need one or more device partitions to store the ZFS on.  Ideally,
   you would give ZFS a number of raw devices rather than a RAID array device.
   Best performance is if you use the full device ("/dev/sda" rather than
   "/dev/sda1").

   For device names, you typically want to use the device files in
   /dev/disk/by-id.

   If you have one big device, use:

      zpool create -o ashift=12 backups DEV_FILE

   If you have many devices and want to be able to survive a single device
   failure:

      zpool create -o ashift=12 backups raidz DEV_FILE [...]


   If you want to be able to survive 2 device failures, at the cost of losing
   two discs worth of storage capacity:

      zpool create -o ashift=12 backups raidz2 DEV_FILE [...]

Tuning ZFS

   You probably want to enable compression:

      zfs set compression=on backups

   You *MIGHT* want to set deduplication:

      zfs set dedup=verify backups

   However, deduplication can be very hard on the system.  It needs plenty of
   RAM, probably at least 8GB (for a small home backup server).  My work backup
   server would need 64GB to be happy with dedup.
   
   Ideally it should have a L2ARC device on SSD:

      zpool add backups cache SSD_DEV_FILE

Install Requirements

   apt-get install python-psycopg2 libapache2-mod-wsgi postgresql mailutils \
         python-cherrypy3 python-routes python-genshi python-formencode

Install tummy-backup Master

   mkdir -p /etc/tummy-backup
   echo dbname=tummybackup user=tummybackup password=PASSWORD host=127.0.0.1 >/etc/tummy-backup/dbconnect
   chmod 640 /etc/tummy-backup/dbconnect
   chown root:www-data /etc/tummy-backup/dbconnect

   su postgres -c 'createuser -DRSP tummybackup'
   <Enter the password from above>
   su postgres -c 'createdb -O tummybackup tummybackup'
   su postgres -c 'psql -d tummybackup --quiet' <schema.sql

   mkdir /usr/local/lib/tummy-backup
   cp -av . /usr/local/lib/tummy-backup
   cd /usr/local/lib/tummy-backup
   mkdir www/keys
   ssh-keygen -t dsa -N '' -f www/keys/identity
   chown www-data:www-data www/keys/identity
   chmod 400 www/keys/identity
   chown www-data:www-data www/keys
   chmod 700 www/keys

   cp files/apache-tummy-backup.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/tummy-backup.conf
   /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

   htpasswd -c /etc/tummy-backup/htpasswd admin
   <Enter a password for the web interface>

   Add the "www/keys/identity.pub" data to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys prefixed
   by this, with the key at the end of the second line:

      #  for tummy-backup webcmd
      no-pty,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,command="/usr/local/lib/tummy-backup/sbin/webcmd"

   Test this by running:

      echo ping | SSH_AUTH_SOCK= ssh -i /usr/local/lib/tummy-backup/www/keys/identity root@`hostname` true

   This might ask you to verify the host key, and then it should respond with
   "Pong".  If it does not, there is a problem that will prevent the web
   interface from working.

   The host key also needs to be available to the web server user.  Probably
   the best way to do this is to:

      cp /root/.ssh/known_hosts /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
      chmod 644 /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts

   cp files/cron-tummy-backup-master /etc/cron.d/tummy-backup-master

Install tummy-backup Node

   [THESE NOTES ARE INCOMPLETE, I HAVEN'T DONE A NEW NODE-ONLY SETUP]

   mkdir /usr/local/lib/tummy-backup
   cp -av . /usr/local/lib/tummy-backup
